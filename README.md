# Double-box-filter-for-fitting-COCO-Halo-Mass-Function-simulations
#COCO simulations from Bose et.al (2016) are fited using the new Double Box filter.

#All the code can be executed without any extra library than numpy, matplotlib and scipy. It will return several figures:

#Figure 1: power spectrum for CDM and for the WDM with a transfer function with the parameters selected above

#Figure 2: variance as a function of mass for k-sharp filter and for CDM (blue) and WDM (orange)

# Double-box-filter-for-fitting-COCO-Halo-Mass-Function-simulations
#COCO simulations from Bose et.al (2016) are fitted using the new Double Box filter.
#comments are in catalan, for following versions I am going to translate it, however, symbols are the frequent ones from excursion set formalism
#all the code can be executed without any extra library incorpored and it will return several figures:
#figure1: power spectrum for CDM and for the WDM with a transfer function with the parameters selected above
#figure2:variance as a function of mass

# Double-box-filter-for-fitting-COCO-Halo-Mass-Function-simulations
#COCO simulations from Bose et.al (2016) are fitted using the new Double Box filter.
#comments are in catalan, for following versions I am going to translate them, however, symbols are the common ones from excursion set formalism
#all the code can be executed without any extra library incorpored and it will return several figures:
#figure1: power spectrum for CDM and for the WDM with a transfer function with the parameters selected above
#figure2:variance as a function of mass for k-sharp filter and for CDM (blue) and WDM (orange) 
#figure3:derivative of the variance as a function of k for CDM (blue) and WDM (orange)
#figure4:simmulation points from Bose et.al (2016)
#figure5:fit for the CDM and WDM halo mass function for the simmulation points from Bose et.al (2016)
#figure6:variance as a function of mass for smooth-k, Double Box and four boxes filter for WDM 
#figure7:derivative of the variance as a function of k for smooth-k, Double Box and four boxes filter for WDM 
#figure8:fit for the WDM halo mass function with an smooth-k filter using the simmulation points from Bose et.al (2016)
#figure9:fit for the WDM halo mass function with a Double Box filter using the simmulation points from Bose et.al (2016)
#figure10:fit for the WDM halo mass function with a four boxes filter using the simmulation points from Bose et.al (2016)
